go ahead and work on the game by using `bd` to guide your progress. if you encounter any new work items, put them in `bd`. rely on `bd` to guide you and future agents. build debug target while developing, but build a release target when you are complete.


ok. thoroughly read through your `bd` epics and issues and ask me important clarifying questions. put the answers back into `bd`. `bd` is the only place to store information that guides the project
